Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

### What I learned

I learned to know flexbox better and use CSS properties better.
Instead, in the HTML structure, it always remains semantic and clean.

Here too, I enjoyed using media queries because you learn to manage the spaces of any device.

The only useful source that I used often, is the "CSS Cheat Sheet" of devchallenges.io because it provides a series of useful instructions to make the styles you have applied readable.

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge. -->

### Useful resources

- [Essential CSS Cheat Sheet](https://devchallenges.io/learn/2-responsive-web/css-essential-cheat-sheet#9.-Media-Queries) - From the official site that I completed the project, I reviewed the media queries of how they were composed and useful lines to avoid using excessive margins and padding
<!--
- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
